  MCU type: STC15F204EA
  F/W version: 6.7R

Current H/W Option:
  . Do not detect the level of P3.2 and P3.3 next download
  . Power-on reset, use the general power-on delay
  . RESET pin behaves as IO pin
  . Interrupt while detect a Low-Voltage
  . Thresh voltage level of the built-in LVD : 3.61 V
  . Permit EEPROM operation under Low-Voltag
  . Hardware do not enable Watch-Dog-Timer
  . Watch-Dog-Timer pre-scalar : 64
  . Watch-Dog-Timer stop count in idle mode
  . Program can modify the Watch-Dog-Timer scalar
  . Do not erase user EEPROM area at next download
